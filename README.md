Ripe is the tool to empower your organization with seamless, anonymous, and secure voting on critical decisions. Our platform leverages MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) from PSE Team to protect voter privacy and ensure tamper-proof results, all within a user-friendly environment where discussions and proposals come to life.

## Santi's Branch

In this branch the login with thirdweb (account abstraction) is done, and domain verification is performed through the JWT. Also, in /api/auth/route, there is a script for the admin to deliver the attestation to the user. The only thing left is to update the information on the frontend.
